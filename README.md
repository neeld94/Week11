# A simple introduction to JavaScript and Local Storage!

*Clone* this repository using `git clone https://github.com/CTEC3905/javascript_02_localstorage` instead of just downloading it. Before you push, you will need to change the GIT remote to your own repository for this code with the following command: `git remote set-url origin [YOUR_REPO_URL_HERE]`.

This exercise builds on JavaScript 01 by using localstorage to retain some data between sessions, so you can close the browser window and the data remains in placeâ€”for that user and their browser only.
